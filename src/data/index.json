When a selection is made, the app will present the User with a list of results for drink recipes that contain that liquor type. When the User finds a recipe that they want to know how to make, they click the recipe button which, when clicked, will load the recipe page that contains the drink name, an image of the drink, with a list of ingredients and their measurements followed by the instructions on how to prepare the drink. This app fetches from the free CocktailDB API to provide it with the information it displays.",
